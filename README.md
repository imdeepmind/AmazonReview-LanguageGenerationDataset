# AmazonReview-LanguageGenerationDataset
Processed Amazon Review Dataset for Language Generation (Character Level)

Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/imdeepmind/language-generation-dataset-200m-samples/

Here for preparing the dataset, I've used tiny fraction (only `amazon_reviews_us_Musical_Instruments_v1_00.tsv.gz` file) of the [Amazon Product Review](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html) dataset.
